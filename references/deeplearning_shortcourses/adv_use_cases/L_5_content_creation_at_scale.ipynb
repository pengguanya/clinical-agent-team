This article and subheading were amended on 29 September 2024. An earlier version said that the S&P 500 index had registered a near 100% gain on a year ago when that should have said five years ago. It has risen 34% in the last year.Explore more on these topicsStock marketsInterest ratesEconomicsInflationChinaEuropeFederal ReservenewsShareReuse this contentMore on this storyMore on this storyGlobal stock markets plunge amid ‘Trump tariff tantrum’3h ago‘Sputnik moment’: $1tn wiped off US stocks after Chinese firm unveils AI chatbot7d agoWall Street shrugs off Trump after he vows Mexico and Canada tariffs21 Jan 2025A year of two halves: how global financial markets fared in 20241 Jan 2025Global markets tipped to keep rising in 2025 despite trade war fears30 Dec 2024Chinese stocks suffer worst fall in 27 years over growth concerns9 Oct 2024Threat to stock markets comes from China and Middle East, not the US11 Aug 2024Why August is one of the most dangerous months in the financial calendar9 Aug 2024Most viewedMost viewedBusinessEconomicsBankingMoneyMarketsProject SyndicateB2BRetailNewsOpinionSportCultureLifestyleOriginal reporting and incisive analysis, direct from the Guardian every morningSign up for our emailAbout usHelpComplaints & correctionsSecureDropWork for us Privacy policyCookie policyTerms & conditionsContact usAll topicsAll writersDigital newspaper archiveTax strategyFacebookYouTubeInstagramLinkedInNewslettersAdvertise with usGuardian LabsSearch jobsBack to top© 2025 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
