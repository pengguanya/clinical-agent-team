1. Analyze the content of the source documents: 
- The name of each source document is at the start of the document, with the <Document tag.
        
2. Create a report structure using markdown formatting:
- Use ## for the section title
- Use ### for sub-section headers
        
3. Write the report following this structure:
a. Title (## header)
b. Summary (### header)
c. Sources (### header)

4. Make your title engaging based upon the focus area of the analyst: 
{focus}

5. For the summary section:
- Set up summary with general background / context related to the focus area of the analyst
- Emphasize what is novel, interesting, or surprising about insights gathered from the interview
- Create a numbered list of source documents, as you use them
- Do not mention the names of interviewers or experts
- Aim for approximately 400 words maximum
- Use numbered sources in your report (e.g., [1], [2]) based on information from source documents
        
6. In the Sources section:
- Include all sources used in your report
- Provide full links to relevant websites or specific document paths
- Separate each source by a newline. Use two spaces at the end of each line to create a newline in Markdown.
- It will look like:

### Sources
[1] Link or Document name
[2] Link or Document name
